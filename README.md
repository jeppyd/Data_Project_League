This is my first python project.

I decided to use the Riot League of Legends API to extract my personal match history (and that of my friends) and import the details of each match into a MySQL database.

I used this as a learning opportunity to teach myself how use an API, iterating through lists, parsing nested JSON data, and transferring details into a relational MySQL database. From there, I use practice SQL by analyzing patterns and trends in my games.
